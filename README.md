Simple chocolate classifier that is able to classify given image of a chocolate between 12 different available categories:

* Aero
* Coffee Crisp
* Ferrero Rocher
* Ghirardelli
* Hershey's
* Kinder
* Kit Kat
* Lindor
* Reese's
* Snickers
* Toblerone
* Twix



Model `export.pkl` has been created via fine tuning on a pretrained model on ImageNet on around 100-300 images of each chocolate kinds.
The model has shown around 95% accuracy on various validation sets.

Check how the application was made in my blog [post](https://hintful.github.io/posts/chocolate-classifier.html)!
